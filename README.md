# CrowdSec Envoy Proxy Bouncer

A lightweight [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) bouncer for [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) using the ext_authz filter.

## Features

- Block malicious IPs streamed via CrowdSec decisions
- Bouncer metrics reporting
- Request inspection via CrowdSec AppSec
- CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious IPs with support for:
  - Google reCAPTCHA v2
  - Cloudflare Turnstile

## How It Works

The bouncer integrates with Envoy Proxy as an external authorization service, sitting between Envoy and your backend applications. It evaluates every request through a multi-stage security pipeline:

### Request Processing Flow

1. **IP Extraction**
    - Extracts the real client IP from forwarded headers, respecting trusted proxy configuration
2. **Bouncer Check**
    - Queries the local decision cache for IP-based actions (ban or captcha)
    - Decisions are streamed in real-time from CrowdSec via the Stream API
    - Low-latency lookups using in-memory cache
3. **WAF Analysis**
    - If enabled and no blocking decision exists then the request is forwarded to Crowdsec AppSec for inspection
4. **Decision Enforcement**
    - **Allow** - Request proceeds to backend
    - **Ban** - Returns 403 with ban page
    - **Captcha** - Creates session and redirects to challenge

### Ban Flow

When a banned IP attempts access, they receive a 403 response with a ban page:

### CAPTCHA Flow

When CAPTCHA is enabled and a suspicious request is detected:

1. Bouncer creates a secure session and redirects to `/captcha/challenge?session=<id>`
2. User completes the CAPTCHA challenge (reCAPTCHA v2 or Cloudflare Turnstile)
3. Challenge response is verified at `/captcha/verify`
4. On success, the IP is allowlisted and user is redirected to their original destination
